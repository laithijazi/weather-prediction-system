# Weather Forecasting System

## Istanbul Medipol University  
### Localized Weather Prediction System for Istanbul Medipol University Using LSTM

---

## Overview

Weather forecasts are essential for decision-making and planning. This project develops a user-
friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to provide accurate weather predictions tailored for
Istanbul Medipol University and its surroundings. Using historical weather data, a Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is trained to predict patterns over time. Missing data is
filled with Lagrange interpolation, and cubic spline interpolation is applied for smooth trend
visualization. An API integrates real-time data, allowing users to view current conditions for
any city, alongside localized predictions for the university area. This system aims to deliver
precise and actionable insights to support campus planning and activities.

## Features

  - Handles missing data using **Lagrange interpolation**  
  - Uses **natural cubic spline interpolation** for smooth trend visualization  
  - Predicts temperature, humidity, and pressure using an **LSTM neural network**  
  - Fetches live weather data via **OpenWeatherMap API**  
  - Built with **Tkinter** and **ttkbootstrap** for easy visualization and interaction

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Historical weather data—from January 1, 2019, to December 30, 2024—is gathered, capturing key details like temperature, humidity, and pressure. Missing values are first filled using backward filling, then refined with Lagrange interpolation to ensure the dataset remains continuous. Finally, cubic spline interpolation smooths the data into continuous curves, clearly showing weather trends over time.

2. **Model Training and Prediction:**
The cleaned data is scaled with a MinMaxScaler and split into training and testing sets. An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network is then built and trained on this historical data, leveraging its ability to capture long-term dependencies. Once trained, the model predicts future weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and pressure) for the Istanbul Medipol University area, with predictions converted back to their original scale for easy interpretation.

3. **Real-Time Data Integration:**
Live weather data is fetched via the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieving current conditions like temperature (converted from Kelvin to Celsius), humidity, and pressure.

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
The system features an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter and enhanced with ttkbootstrap. Users can enter a city name to view both current weather (sourced via the API) and forecasted conditions (generated by the LSTM model). Robust error handling ensures that issues such as incorrect city names or API errors are managed smoothly providing a seamless user experience.
